      YAAAYYYY!!! </br> I'm so so so so so happy!!!! Obviously when you see this it
         will be later on but im still gonna be smiling even then by myself, just the 
         same way I'm smiling while making this whole thing. I want to show you how special 
         you are to me and how grateful I am for you to be here even reading this. I know 
         its just the beginning of what we have, but im just so comfortable and happy 
         of where we are right now, where I am right now. Thank you my love
          for being you through 
         everything not just for me, but for yourself as well.</br>
        See you on the 14th!ðŸ’‹
